# NetStorm 3D

An A-Frame reimagining of *NetStorm: Islands At War* (1997): floating islands, bridges and Storm
Power in a 3D scene you can orbit. The rules, the missions and the computer opponent come from
[netstorm-web](https://github.com/x-ror/netstorm-web), a browser remake of the game, which this
project uses unchanged as its engine. This repository is the 3D client around it.

**Play:** https://misterclarity.github.io/netstorm-3d/ (once GitHub Pages is on, see below)

## What you can play

Mission 1, *The War Begins!*, against netstorm-web's computer opponent:

1. Your **Priest** builds a **Sun Workshop**. Put the **Sun Cannon** into its production slots.
2. Build **Golems** at your Temple and send them to **geysers** for Storm Power.
3. Lay **bridge pieces** (they arrive in your hand over time and join only by their ends) toward
   the islets and the enemy in the east.
4. Build **Sun Cannons** where your Energy reaches. A Rain Workshop unlocks Rain Generators, which
   carry Energy further out.
5. Knock the enemy Priest out, have a Golem carry him to your **Altar**, then send your Priest to
   the Altar to perform the sacrifice.

A *Next step* card reads the state of the battle and tells you what to do next. **Help** in the
top bar lists the controls: orbit by dragging, pan with right-drag or Shift-drag, zoom with the
wheel or a pinch, `R` rotates pieces and cannons, `Esc` cancels, `Space` pauses.

Two art styles can be switched in the top bar:

- **3D**: low-poly models made for this project.
- **Sprites**: the original game's sprites as cards standing in the 3D world, with its grass
  tiles on the islands. They are not part of this repository. The page loads them at run time
  from netstorm-web's repository on GitHub, at the commit the submodule pins. Where the page may
  not load images from other sites, the button stays off and the models are used.

## Running it

You need Node.js 20 or newer.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/misterclarity/netstorm-3d
cd netstorm-3d
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:8080, rebuilt as you edit
```

Already cloned without `--recurse-submodules`? Run `git submodule update --init` first.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Builds in watch mode and serves the page on port 8080 (set `PORT` to change it). |
| `npm run build` | Writes `dist/index.html`: one self-contained file you can open directly or host anywhere. A-Frame loads from its CDN. |
| `npm run check` | Plays the mission headless for a couple of minutes of game time (no browser), failing on any error. CI runs it. |

## How it is built

The whole scene is A-Frame: [`index.html`](index.html) declares the sky, the lights, the clouds,
the terrain, the units, the effects and the camera as entities, and `src/` registers the shader,
systems and components they use.

| Piece | Kind | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ns-game` | system | Runs the match each frame (netstorm-web's `World`, its AI in a Web Worker), turns clicks and keys into the game's commands, passes events to the HUD and effects. |
| `ns-art` | system | Loads the original sprites and switches between the two art styles. |
| `ns-sky` | shader | The gradient sky on `<a-sky>`. |
| `orbit-rig` | component | The orbiting camera; emits `ns-tap` and `ns-hover` for the game. |
| `ns-sun` | component | Shadow settings the `light` component does not cover. |
| `ns-clouds` | component | A ring of instanced low-poly clouds (used twice, `__low` and `__high`). |
| `ns-terrain` | component | The floating islands and the bridges, rebuilt when the world's terrain changes. |
| `ns-units` / `ns-unit` | components | One `<a-entity ns-unit="id: N">` per thing in the world: model or sprite card, smooth movement, health bar. |
| `ns-residence` | component | The map's Residences. |
| `ns-effects` | component | Shells in flight, impacts, explosions, falling bridges and islets. |
| `ns-placement` | component | Bridge and building previews with the reason a spot is refused, Energy and range rings, selection. |

The HUD (`src/hud.js`) is plain DOM over the scene. `src/models.js` holds the low-poly models.

**netstorm-web** sits in `vendor/netstorm-web` as a git submodule pinned to one commit. The build
bundles its TypeScript straight from there (`src/engine.js` lists what is used: the simulation,
the mission set-up, the mission script's events, the AI schedule and worker). Its client's
compiled interface strings are replaced by `src/messages.js`, which reads its English messages
file. To follow netstorm-web, update the submodule and rebuild:

```sh
git -C vendor/netstorm-web pull origin main
npm run check && npm run build
git add vendor/netstorm-web && git commit -m "Update netstorm-web"
```

Moving the pinned commit also moves the URLs the original sprites are read from
(`scripts/make-data.js` writes them to `build/art.json`).

**Deploying:** [`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](.github/workflows/pages.yml) runs the check, builds
`dist/` and publishes it to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`. Pages has to be set to deploy
from GitHub Actions once (*Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions*).

## Not there yet

- Only the first mission. The engine has the rest of the campaign and random skirmish maps; the
  next-step hints and some models are written for mission 1.
- No sound or music.
- In "Sprites" mode each unit is one still frame, not the original's animation.
- Tested in desktop Chromium; phones and other browsers are less tried.
